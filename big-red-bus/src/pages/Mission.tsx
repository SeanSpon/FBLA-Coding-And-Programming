            The Big Red Bus began with a simple idea: to create a mobile hub for
            connection and support, driving awareness for mental health and autism
            directly into our communities. The bus itself is a symbol of our
            journeyâ€”approachable, friendly, and always on the move to meet people
            where they are.

# Presentation Script — FBLA Coding & Programming (2–3 min)

## 1. Intro
- Welcome! This is our FBLA Coding & Programming MVP.
- It’s a modern React + Vite app, built for clarity, speed, and rubric coverage.

## 2. Home Page
- The Home page welcomes users and explains the project’s purpose.
- Navigation is always visible at the top for easy access.

## 3. Items Feature (Core)
- Go to the Items page.
- Add a new item (e.g., “Milk”, with notes “2%”).
- See it appear instantly in the list.
- Delete an item to show CRUD in action.
- Refresh the page — items persist thanks to localStorage.

## 4. About Page
- The About page lists tech stack and project highlights.

## 5. Testing & CI
- We have automated tests for both logic and UI.
- GitHub Actions runs lint, tests, and build on every push/PR.

## 6. Deployment
- The app is live on Vercel: https://vercel.com/seanspons-projects/fbla-coding-and-programming-web

## 7. Wrap-up
- Clean code, clear docs, and a working demo — ready for FBLA judges!
